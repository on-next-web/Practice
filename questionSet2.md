## 1. Is the Number Less than or Equal to Zero?

Create a function that takes a number as its only argument and returns true if it's less than or equal to zero, otherwise return false.

Examples ðŸ‘‡

lessThanOrEqualToZero(2) âžž false

lessThanOrEqualToZero(0) âžž true

lessThanOrEqualToZero(-7) âžž true
## 2. Less Than 100?

Given two numbers, return true if the sum of both numbers is less than 100. Otherwise return false.

Examples ðŸ‘‡

lessThan100(22, 15) âžž true
// 22 + 10 = 32

lessThan100(83, 34) âžž false
// 80 + 40 = 120
## 3. Akhter wants to swap two given numbers!

It is not returning the right values. Can you help him fix it?

a = 10

b = 20

a, b = swap(a, b)

print(a, b) // Should print out "20, 10", but the function prints out "10, 10"
Examples ðŸ‘‡

swap(10, 20) âžž [20, 10]
## 4 .The Farm Problem
In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

chickens = 2 legs

cows = 4 legs

pigs = 4 legs

The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

Examples ðŸ‘‡

animals(2, 4, 5) âžž 40

animals(1, 2, 3) âžž 22
## 5. JavaScript has a logical operator &&. The && operator takes two boolean values, and returns true if both values are true.
Consider a && b:

a is checked if it is true or false.

If a is false, false is returned.

b is checked if it is true or false.

If b is false, false is returned.

Otherwise, true is returned (as both a and b are therefore true ).
The && operator will only return true for true && true.

Make a function using the && operator.

Examples ðŸ‘‡

and(true, false) âžž false

and(true, true) âžž true

and(false, true) âžž false

and(false, false) âžž false
## 6. Are the Numbers Equal?
Create a function that returns true when num1 is equal to num2; otherwise return false.

Examples ðŸ‘‡

isSameNum(2, 6) âžž false

isSameNum(4, 4) âžž  true

isSameNum(2, "2") âžž false
## 7. Football Points
Create a function that takes the number of wins, draws and losses and calculates the number of points a football team has obtained so far.

wins get 3 points

draws get 1 point

losses get 0 points

Examples ðŸ‘‡

footballPoints(2, 4, 2) âžž 10

footballPoints(5, 0, 2) âžž 15

## 8. Equality Check
In this challenge, you must verify the equality of two different values given the parameters a and b.

Both the value and type of the parameters need to be equal. The possible types of the given parameters are:

Numbers

Strings

Booleans (false or true)

Special values: undefined, null and NaN

Implement a function that returns true if the parameters are equal, and false if they are not.

Examples ðŸ‘‡

checkEquality(1, true) âžž false
// A number and a boolean: the value and type are different.

checkEquality(0, "0") âžž false
// A number and a string: the type is different.

checkEquality(1,  1) âžž true
// A number and a number: the type and value are equal.

## 9. Profitable Gamble
Create a function that takes three arguments prob, prize, pay and returns true if prob * prize > pay; otherwise return false.

Examples ðŸ‘‡

profitableGamble(0.2, 50, 9) âžž true

profitableGamble(0.9, 1, 2) âžž false

profitableGamble(0.9, 3, 2) âžž true

## 10. Miserable Parody of a Calculator
Create a function that will handle simple math expressions. The input is an expression in the form of a string.

Examples ðŸ‘‡

calculator("20+4") âžž 24

calculator("40-10") âžž 30
